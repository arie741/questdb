## Concept & Rationale

When toying with clojure for the first time, sometimes we want to focus on the applicability of the language
before getting into the more 'serious' stuffs like integrating with a 'serious' database, but want
to be able to persist data into disk in a more structural way than a simple file. This lightweight
database intends to serve such needs.
